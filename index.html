    <div class="content-container">
      <p>The United States' demographic at the highest risk of child abandonment and adult homelessness are lesbian,
        gay, bisexual, and transgender people. This problem impacts LGBT+ people across all societies, and concerns
        anyone who would be able to help: that is, anyone who has any contact with an LGBT+ person. LGBT+ people will
        continue to face denial of support and indifference from public services as long as ignorance of this problem
        continues.</p>

        <p>An individual facing homelessness any time in their life is likely to experience poor outcomes. The Williams
          Institute of Law conducted one of few extensive studies on LGBT+ American homelessness. They discovered lesbian,
          gay, bisexual, and genderqueer respondents were three times as likely to be homeless in the last year than
          cisgender respondents. Transgender respondents were seven times as likely, and these figures were double looking
          at only respondents who were black. </p>
        <p>Street Kids, a nonprofit researching unaccompanied youth and child abandonment, found that over 4 in 10
          surveyed unaccompanied minors identified LGBT - compared to under 2 in 10 who identify in the general
          population. </p>
